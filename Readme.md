## Goal

Implement a secure cloud environment for Virtual Machine.

## Workshop Scenario

There are multiple ways to attack or still data from servers. On the other hands, there are also many services to protect data from variety of threat. To have a safe environment multiple level of protection should be considered and implemented. Also monitoring is important as well. For a secure cloud environment, you can leverage many Azure Services to protect data from different level of attacks. For example, simple you can use Network Security Group to control network access to a Virtual Machine. Or you can use Key Vault to encrypt database on the Virtual Machine.

## Architecture
